Opening ~ user folder we found a level02.pcap
This pcap file is a trace of a tcp traffic
We've sent it to our host with SCP
And openned it in Wireshark, wich is a software to analyse traffic
We seen that there is a "password" sequence with the follow menu.
The password is clear text written, with few particularities: such as 7F (DEL) so we had to del the n-times we see this char.
it gives us ft_waNDReL0L
